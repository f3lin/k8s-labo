# Using Wildcard Certificates in Kubernetes with cert-manager

## Overview
Using a wildcard certificate simplifies securing multiple applications in Kubernetes, as you only need a single certificate to cover multiple subdomains. This approach is especially efficient for deploying applications in the same namespace. By managing DNS records and ingress configuration, you can streamline SSL/TLS management for your services.

## Key Components
- **cert-manager**: Automates the management and renewal of certificates in your cluster.
- **Let's Encrypt**: Provides free and trusted SSL/TLS certificates.
- **Cloudflare**: Acts as your DNS provider, simplifying DNS-based challenges required by Let's Encrypt.

## Benefits
1. **Scalability**: Secure multiple subdomains without managing individual certificates.
2. **Ease of Use**: Deploy applications in the same namespace and update DNS records with minimal effort.
3. **Automation**: cert-manager handles certificate issuance and renewal automatically.
